## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write your agent" icon="code">
    Build your agent locally using the [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-agent-sdk). Any Python script that reads a prompt and writes a response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    One command packages your code, uploads it, and installs dependencies.
    ```bash
    superserve deploy
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run from anywhere" icon="play">
    Interactive conversations or single-turn prompts — from your terminal or any API client.
    ```bash
    superserve run my-agent "Summarize this document"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Built for Claude Agent SDK

Superserve is designed to deploy agents built with the [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-agent-sdk).

Your `superserve.yaml` specifies the name and start command:

```yaml
name: my-agent
command: python main.py
```

<Tip>
  That's it. No framework boilerplate, no infrastructure config. Just your agent code and a two-line YAML.
